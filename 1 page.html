        <h1>Technology :- </h1>

       <p> The definition of technology is the application of scientific knowledge for practical purposes
           or applications. Technology uses scientific principles, and applies them to change the 
           environment in which humans live. Technology can also use scientific principles to advance 
           industry or other human constructions. Problems exist in the human environment and have for 
           all of history. The existence of problems is what creates technological advancement; where 
           there is struggle and tension, there is ingenuity and creativity.</p>

           <h1>Types of technology:-</h1>
           <p>
            Types of technology include mechanical technology, medical technology, communications 
            technology, electronic technology, and industrial and manufacturing technologies. Though 
            these different types of technology all serve different purposes, range in design, and are 
            applied in different ways, they all have one thing in common: they all solve a problem.</p>
